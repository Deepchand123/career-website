# Career-Website
In this project, we developed a Web-Based Networking Platform for Education and Career Progression where students can access all the required knowledge, and skills as well as interact with the community and other users in one place for career guidance. Also, we have integrated Career Prediction using machine learning and automated Chatbots to solve customer concerns and queries.

# Project Idea

# Expected Outcomes
1. Integrate the system on one platform.
2. Reduce the complexity of finding the learning resources.
3. Increase the end user’s quantity for better communication among the users.
4. Improve student knowledge and technical skills.
5. Students will get proper career direction to develop their own startup-building concepts.
